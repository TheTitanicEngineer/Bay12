### LICENSE

Source code authored since `1420675200 +0000` (that is, the UTC start of `2015 January 8th`) is made available under **AGPL 3** terms as stated in [/LICENSE](/LICENSE).

Source code authored *before* the above is available under **GPL 3** terms as stated in [/docs/gpl-3.0.txt](/docs/gpl-3.0.txt).

For our purposes, the difference between these two licenses is that the AGPL requires you to make your source code available if you are hosting a game that uses Baystation source code in **any** way. The GPL instead allows you to (usually) remain closed source.

Unless otherwise indicated, non-code sources (images, sound, etc.) are available under **CC-3-BY-SA** terms as stated in [/docs/cc3-by-sa.txt](/docs/cc3-by-sa.txt).

### DOWNLOADING & INSTALLING

For regular use, see the **Installation Guide** ([/docs/installation.md](/docs/installation.md)) for instructions on obtaining, installing, updating, and running this project.

Some people come here with the aim of starting a closed source Space Station 13 project. That will be challenging - the code you can use for that is antiquated. Please read the License section if you skipped it. If that doesn't deter you, the [last-gpl-commit](https://github.com/Baystation12/Baystation12/releases/tag/last-gpl-commit) tag is where to begin. You will need [BYOND 507](https://www.byond.com/download/build/507/).
