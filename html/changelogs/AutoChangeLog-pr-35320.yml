      and empty magazines. Supply point costs adjusted to match. The ammoboxes are
      also the new ones that I might have forgotten to actually implement. Includes
      some QOL features such as clicking on empty magazines with a box to speed-fill
      the mag, or a box with a mag to speed-empty it.'}
