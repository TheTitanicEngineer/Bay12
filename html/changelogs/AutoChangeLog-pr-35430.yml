  - {tweak: 'Removing a suppressor from a gun is now a separate verb, clicking on
      your gun with an empty hand removes the magazine as normal'}
  - {rscadd: Adds the ability for the WT-550 Saber (sec SMG) to take the same 
      suppressor as the Lumoco P3 Whisper (holdout pistol)}
  - {rscadd: Puts the suppressed gunshot noise from the Jaguar onto the 
      suppressed holdout pistol and SMG}
  - {tweak: Cleans up and generalizes some of the underlying sprite logic for 
      suppressors}
